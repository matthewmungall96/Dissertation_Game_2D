##Space Ace (Development Build 2.01)##

######################################
#
#Space Ace is an educationally focused game, which aims to build an immersive and learning experience for the player.
#
#After the success of the intial implementation, the game will now be heavily modified to fit within a store front experience. This is shown through the mixture of multiple choice
based questions and 2D side-scroller shooting.
#
#To do this, the following features will be implemented in Vers. 2.00;
#
#* Removal of the Score-Based store in favour of a Skill Point based system.

#* Configuring the game to run on Android devices (adding buttons and joysticks to allow for direct input).

#* Adding a hub-world to allow for the player to interact with objects outside of the ship.

#* Expanding levels and adding levels not created for the intial build (Adding the third level to each location and adding the Venus location).

#* A surivial focused gameplay mode, that will allow the player to indefinetely experience the game until they reach an endstate (either through quitting out or being killed by
  the enemy ships).

#* A proper ending to each location, showcasing how the player's actions have affected the landscape.

#* A shield mechanic, which will absorb the damage taken before it impacts the player's health bar.

#* Improved animations and sound effects.

#* Cell-shading for 2D sprites.

#
#This solo project is run and maintained by Matthew George Mungall, a First Class Honours Graduate from University of the West of Scotland, Lanarkshire Campus. To get in contact
